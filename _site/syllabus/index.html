  <p>SVA SUMMER INTENSIVE</p>

<h1 id="the-practice-of-ixd">The Practice of IxD</h1>

<p>Mondays, 6:00–8:50 PM, July 10 – August 7 2017</p>

<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>Interaction designers enjoy an increasing number of tools, processes, philosophies, languages, and devices with which to deliver their message. They must embrace the constraints and the possibilities of 2D layouts, 3D hardware, and 4D timelines. This class presents both conceptual frameworks and practical methods for responsive web design, taking students through a user-centered, mobile-first, iterative process.</p>

<p>Students will map and prototype a responsive web experience in low- and high-fidelity, working with a partner as either the UX lead or the UI lead and collaborating on user testing. The five-week class will cover the unique major principles of interaction design:</p>

<p>Week 1: <strong>Audience</strong> — respect, responsibility, transparency, context, outreach<br />
Week 2: <strong>Aesthetics</strong> — emotion, personality, hierarchy, readability, usability, memory<br />
Week 3: <strong>Architecture</strong> — autonomy, navigation, patterns, systems, affordances, signifiers<br />
Week 4: <strong>States</strong> — defaults, locations, history, expectations, feedback, accessibility<br />
Week 5: <strong>Critique</strong> — objectivity, subjectivity, framing, phrasing, metrics</p>

<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>By the end of the course, students will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Map and plan a responsive web design project</li>
  <li>Prototype testable interactions in low or high fidelity</li>
  <li>Grasp interaction design essentials: typography, layout, color, motion, and behavior</li>
  <li>Measure success in both qualitative and quantitative terms</li>
  <li>Work in teams, iterations, and short deadlines</li>
  <li>Critique and receive critique of interaction design</li>
</ul>

<p>They will create:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Concepts for a responsive web experience</li>
  <li>Low-fi mobile and desktop prototypes</li>
  <li>Site maps, mood boards, and element collages</li>
  <li>Hi-fi mobile and desktop prototypes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>30% class participation<br />
30% homework and reading<br />
40% final critique</p>

<p>The project for the class is to design an onboarding flow for <a href="https://techsolidarity.org">Tech Solidarity</a>, a grassroots group whose goal is to better connect tech workers with the communities they live in. You and a partner will work to create a responsive experience that serves and builds their community.</p>

<p>(If you volunteer with another organization and would like to design for that group instead, that is a possibility. Email me before the first class.)</p>

<p>This is a pass/fail course. Students who pass will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Present usable, readable, enjoyable designs that serve the intended audience</li>
  <li>Demonstrate an understanding of web hierarchy, aesthetics, and behavior</li>
  <li>Utilize existing interaction patterns (or innovate if appropriate)</li>
  <li>Communicate professionally and collaborate effectively with others</li>
  <li>Pay attention to and participate in thoughtful discussions, exercises, and critiques</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendance at all five classes is mandatory, and tardiness will be a prorated deduction from your participation grade. During presentations and discussions, students are expected to keep laptops closed and other devices put away. During work sessions, students are expected to turn off external distractions such as phone and desktop notifications.</p>

<p>Homework is due at noon on the day of class, and must be submitted via the Google Form on the class website. You will be asked to submit links to your work, notes from your research, and thoughts on your reading.</p>

<p>Final critiques will be roughly 10-15 minutes for each group to present and receive feedback. Each student must also complete an individual critique form for each group.</p>
