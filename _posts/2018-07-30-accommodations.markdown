Be sure your designs are solving the challenge in [the project brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LY8jOjdAFbNZywgRUNT113QbvzQ0QwzSc-v8tnWd3lg/edit?usp=sharing).

1. Finish designing the mobile flow and the desktop flow for your key experience. Work on expressing your brand personality through the major features and any microinteractions. I would expect at least five screens for each. Focus on the ones that best demonstrate your unique solution. 
2. Link up your designs as clickable prototypes in Marvel (you can overwrite your wireframe prototypes, or create new ones). Test with qualified users, using [fivesecondtest.com](http://fivesecondtest.com) or an in-person usability test, and iterate to improve your designs. Feel free to send me drafts or questions this week.
3. Make a copy of the [Presentation Starter Kit](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bXdMrBggzS_2xBqN-hHdabcup1Bg7PqLm_xieUxEiPI) and fill in your details. Make sure the links to your prototypes are the public ones, and that Sam will be able to follow your story.
4. Submit your work to the [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/lRNyBlLQoFu7RHjJ2) by 5pm on Monday. I should see all your responses when I get to class!
