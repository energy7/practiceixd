Please submit your prototype and findings (even if it's incomplete) by *5pm on Sunday* so I have time to review it before class.

1. Test your Marvel prototype with 3+ QUALIFIED users. Watch the ["How to prototype on paper with Marvel for iPhone and iPad"](https://help.marvelapp.com/hc/en-us) help video if you need tips on setting it up.  
2. Submit your findings and a link to your prototype to [the Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/QOfK2pvolYy5lLx03)  
3. (Optional) Read [“The Web's Grain”](https://frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/) by Frank Chimero. What does designing for the web’s grain mean to you?  
4. Watch Lecture #2 (will be posted here on Weds) — same password as before. Jot down any questions.
