1. Please fill out [this quick Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/h2Eny65DtqnV1K5E3) no later than July 8th. You'll be working with a partner in this class and I want to make it as easy as possible for you to find a like-minded one. 
2. Be ready to discuss your answers to the questions in the form.
3. Re-read [the syllabus](/syllabus) and show up to each class with sketching supplies (pencil/pen and paper/sketchbook).
