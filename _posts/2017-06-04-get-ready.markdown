1. Please fill out [this quick Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/2fQdObztdXMF1Jbw1) no later than July 9th. You'll be working with a partner in this class and I want to make it as easy as possible for you to find a like-minded / like-located one. 
2. Re-read [the syllabus](/syllabus) and show up to each class with sketching supplies (pencil, black pen/marker, paper). 
3. Be ready to discuss a site or interaction experience you wish you'd designed, and one you use daily or weekly, and why.
