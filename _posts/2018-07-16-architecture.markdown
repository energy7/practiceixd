Please submit your prototype and findings (even if they're incomplete) by *5pm on Sunday* so I have time to review it before class. Re-read [the project brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LY8jOjdAFbNZywgRUNT113QbvzQ0QwzSc-v8tnWd3lg/edit?usp=sharing) and the [personas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WiU_K7eLKOYP8anvRjNOC9h9rhVjGxC-/view?usp=sharing) as needed.

1. Test your Marvel prototype with 3+ qualified users.   
2. Submit your findings and a link to your prototype to [the Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/43ohWVo6W0M6edrJ3) (by 5pm Sunday)
3. Read *Designing for Emotion* (Ch 1-3, ideally all) — Think about what celebrity might you pick to represent Wikipedia, and what brand traits. We'll make a brand strategy in class.
4. Watch [Lecture #3: Aesthetics](https://vimeo.com/ericaheinz/ixd2018-3) — same password as before. Jot down any questions.
