SVA SUMMER INTENSIVE 2018 

###### The Practice of IxD 

Mondays, 6:00–8:50 PM, July 9 – August 6

## Course Description
 
Interaction designers enjoy an increasing number of tools, processes, philosophies, languages, and devices with which to deliver their message. They must embrace the constraints and the possibilities of 2D layouts, 3D hardware, and 4D timelines. This class presents both conceptual frameworks and practical methods for responsive web design, taking students through a user-centered, mobile-first, iterative process. 
 
Students will map and prototype a responsive web experience in low- and high-fidelity, working with a partner as either the UX lead or the UI lead and collaborating on user testing. The five-week class will cover the unique major principles of interaction design:
 
Week 1: **Audience** — respect, responsibility, transparency, context, outreach  
Week 2: **Architecture** — autonomy, navigation, patterns, systems, affordances, signifiers  
Week 3: **Aesthetics** — emotion, personality, hierarchy, readability, usability, memory  
Week 4: **Accommodations** — defaults, states, history, expectations, feedback, accessibility  
Week 5: **Assessment** — objectivity, subjectivity, framing, phrasing, metrics  

## Learning Objectives
 
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
 
* Map and plan a responsive web design project 
* Prototype testable interactions in low or high fidelity
* Grasp interaction design essentials: typography, layout, color, motion, and behavior
* Measure success in both qualitative and quantitative terms
* Work in teams, iterations, and short deadlines
* Critique and receive critique of interaction design
 
They will create:
 
* Concepts for a responsive web experience
* Low-fi mobile and desktop prototypes
* Site maps and mood boards
* Hi-fi mobile and desktop prototypes

## Grading
 
30% class participation  
30% homework and reading  
40% final critique  
 
The project for this class is to design a key experience for a valuable creative site (to be announced the first day of class). You and a partner will work together as UX Lead and UI Lead, sketching and testing and revising a responsive design at increasing levels of fidelity.
  
This is a pass/fail course. Students who pass will: 
* Present usable, readable, enjoyable designs that serve the intended audience
* Demonstrate an understanding of web hierarchy, aesthetics, and behavior
* Utilize existing interaction patterns (or innovate if appropriate)
* Communicate professionally and collaborate effectively with others
* Pay attention to and participate in thoughtful discussions, exercises, and critiques
 
Attendance at all five classes is mandatory, and tardiness will be a prorated deduction from your participation grade. During presentations and discussions, students are expected to keep laptops closed and other devices put away. During work sessions, students are expected to turn off external distractions such as phone and desktop notifications.
 
Homework is due at noon on the day of class, and must be submitted via the Google Form on the class website. You will be asked to submit links to your work, notes from your research, and thoughts on your reading.
 
Final critiques will be roughly 10-15 minutes for each group to present and receive feedback. Each student must also complete an individual critique form for each group.
